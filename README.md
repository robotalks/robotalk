# RoboTalk

Connect Robotic Components!

RoboTalk turns Robotics logics into LEGO blocks.
The logics include:

- Hardware drivers
- Controlling logics
- AI logics
- Monitoring logics
- Simulation/Visualization logics

These are developed in highly reusable components, and make it possible to
make new Robotics hardware work without writing code.
